### Overview of rules
* Each player has a number of pits and a bank to his/her right.
* Players can move stones from their own pits, excluding banks.
* If a move ends up in Bank, player gets a free turn.
* If a player's move ends in an empty pit of his/her own pits a capture occurs. There's a substantial difference between capture rules in two-player games and games with more than two players:
    * In two-player when the move ends in an empty pit, you capture all the seeds in the pit opposite of yours.
    * In more than two players, the player captures all the seeds in all the corresponding pits of the opponents. (e.g. if your move ends in your second pit, you capture all the seeds in the second pits of your opponenets)
* Capture also moves the seed in the capturing pit to the bank.
* The game ends when the player who holds the turn has no legal move.
